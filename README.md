Tic Tac Toe game in React  
Prints a blank board of 9 squares.  
Indicates if X or O goes next.  
Clicking on a square puts that X or O into the square,  
but only if there isn't already an X or O in that square.  
Checks if there's a winner or not.  
If there's a winner, declares if X or O has won,  
and the game does not continue.  
If there is no winner, continues the game.
